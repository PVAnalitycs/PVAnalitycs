- [Spatial and Functional Analysis of Bird Distribution in the Canton of PoÃ¡s Using Clustering Techniques](link):This project explores the spatial and functional distribution of bird species in the Canton of PoÃ¡s, Costa Rica. Using clustering techniques, the analysis identifies patterns in bird distribution based on ecological and geographical factors. The goal is to provide insights into biodiversity hotspots and functional traits of bird communities, contributing to conservation planning and ecological research. Key aspects of the project include data preprocessing, application of clustering algorithms, and visualization of results to uncover meaningful ecological patterns.
